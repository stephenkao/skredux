        h3 <a href="/">Stephen</a>'s gone.  Left. Disappeared.  Vanished.
        p.
          I'm not sure where he is.  Or if he's even alive at this point.
          He could be lying in pieces, getting scraped off the subway tracks for all I know.
          Or he could be in the Bahamas, laughing his ass off at me for thinking this.
        p.
          In any case, he left a lot of his things here.
          Considering the nearly opaque layers of dust, it doesn't look like it's been touched in a while.
          If you have some time, take a look around and see if you can find something.
        p.
          Just be careful.  I have a bad feeling about this place.

        h3 I've been piecing together a dossier.
        p.
          <a href="/">Stephen</a> was born on <span class="redacted">some date of some year</span>, a habitually taciturn son of <span class="redacted">Ming-Lai</span> and <span class="redacted">Grace Kao</span>.
          As a semi-dyssemic child, he found solace in various forms of escapism, ranging from literature and writing to video games and television.
        p.
          After graduating from <span class="redacted">Emmaus High School</span> in 2007, he attended the <span class="redacted">University of Pittsburgh</span>, majoring in computer science and Chinese.
          He always showed a perverse interest in linguistics and morphology, but any hopes he had of pursuing a career in it were dashed by callous pragmatism.
        p.
          From 2007 through 2013, he worked full-stack engineer at the <span class="redacted">Pittsburgh</span>-based startup <a href="http://flashgroup.com">Flashgroup Inc</a>.
          Before his disappearance, he was last seen working at <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker Media</a> in <span class="redacted">New York</span> as a front-end engineer.

        h3 He also left some <a href="/blog">notes</a>â€”maybe you can make better sense of them.
