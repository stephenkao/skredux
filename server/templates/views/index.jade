        h3 <a href="/">Stephen</a>'s gone.  Left. Disappeared.  Vanished.
        p.
          I'm not sure where he is.  Or if he's even alive at this point.
          He could be lying in pieces, getting scraped off the subway tracks for all I know.
          Or he could be in the Bahamas, laughing his ass off at me for thinking this.
        p.
          Either way, all his stuff is still here.  Considering the nearly opaque layers of dust, it doesn't look like it's been touched in a while.
          Feel free to look around.
        p.
          I have to warn you, though.  This place is a little odd.  Things change.  Things *shift*.
          Thoughts of grotesquerie drift in and out of your head.
        p Ahh, never mind.  I probably sound crazy.  Or am.  Or sound.  Just be careful.

        h3 This is what I've pieced together so far.
        p.
          <a href="/">Stephen</a> was born on [redacted], a habitually taciturn son of [redacted] and [redacted].
        p.
          After graduating from [redacted] High School in 2007, he attended the University of [redacted], majoring in computer science and Chinese.
          He always showed a perverse interest in linguistics and morphology, but any hopes he had of pursuing a career in it were dashed by callous pragmatism.
        p.
          From 2007 through 2013, he worked full-stack engineer at <a href="http://flashgroup.com">Flashgroup Inc</a>.
          Before his disappearance, he was last seen working at <a href="http://gawker.com">Gawker Media</a> as a front-end engineer.

        h3 He left some <a href="/blog">notes</a>â€”maybe you can make better sense of them.
